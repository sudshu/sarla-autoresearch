Plain-language record, newest at the bottom. One entry per iteration plus
setup notes. Times are US Pacific.

## 2026-09-01 setup

- Protocol written (autoresearch.md). Public repo created. Two GPU hosts
  prepared: an H100 (3 slots) and two Blackwell RTX PRO 4500 (1 slot each).
- The first truth rule (iid EDC-feasible prior draws) was rejected before any
  fit: at every site checked, feasible prior draws are near-dead ecosystems
  with GPP below 5% of the observed value. Truths are now jittered real-data
  modes with a GPP and biomass plausibility check.

## Iteration 0 (baseline), launched 2026-09-01 22:15 PDT

- What: the current fast path (v3, `variants/v3_baseline.json`) at the four
  development sites with three kernel seeds each, and once at the four
  holdout sites. 16 fits, five GPU slots.
- Why: fixes the noise floor delta (2 sd of G over seeds) that every later
  accept/reject decision uses, and the baseline G on both site sets.
- Smoke tests before launch: new fitter reproduces v3 bitwise on CPU; the
  DE, stretch and adaptive-covariance kernels run without error at toy scale;
  the queue ran two tiny jobs end to end on the H100.

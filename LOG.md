Plain-language record, newest at the bottom. One entry per iteration plus
setup notes. Times are US Pacific.

## 2026-09-01 setup

- Protocol written (autoresearch.md). Public repo created. Two GPU hosts
  prepared: an H100 (3 slots) and two Blackwell RTX PRO 4500 (1 slot each).
- The first truth rule (iid EDC-feasible prior draws) was rejected before any
  fit: at every site checked, feasible prior draws are near-dead ecosystems
  with GPP below 5% of the observed value. Truths are now jittered real-data
  modes with a GPP and biomass plausibility check.

## Iteration 0 (baseline), launched 2026-09-01 22:15 PDT

- What: the current fast path (v3, `variants/v3_baseline.json`) at the four
  development sites with three kernel seeds each, and once at the four
  holdout sites. 16 fits, five GPU slots.
- Why: fixes the noise floor delta (2 sd of G over seeds) that every later
  accept/reject decision uses, and the baseline G on both site sets.
- Smoke tests before launch: new fitter reproduces v3 bitwise on CPU; the
  DE, stretch and adaptive-covariance kernels run without error at toy scale;
  the queue ran two tiny jobs end to end on the H100.

## Iteration 0 result (2026-09-02 02:40 PDT): baseline G = 1.19 on the development sites, 2.01 on holdout

- The v3 fast path is well calibrated at two sites (ES-LJu G 0.60, DE-Gri 0.78),
  acceptable at NL-Loo (0.79, but one of three seeds never reached the typical
  set: density rank 1.00), and poor at BE-Vie (2.59): there, 22 to 31 of the 89
  parameters sit more than 2 sd from the truth and the LAI projection band
  misses the truth almost everywhere. The BE-Vie truth has a nearly empty wood
  pool, and the sampler's posterior does not contain that solution.
- Holdout: CZ-wet 1.21, DE-Geb 1.05, FR-Pue 1.58, DK-Sor 4.18 (the flagged
  relaxed-plausibility truth; the sampler never found its region at all).
- Noise floor: the dev-set mean G over three kernel seeds has sd 0.11, so the
  acceptance threshold delta is fixed at 0.22 from here on.
- Cost: median 53 min per fit with three fits sharing the H100 or one per
  Blackwell GPU (about 25 min alone on the H100), 2.4M model evaluations.
- No chain was stuck at any site (the region screen and restarts from the
  earlier OSSE work hold up), so the remaining error is mixing and coverage,
  not junk regions.
